        <span class="byAuthor">By Samira Gadri &#124; Sept 5th, 2018</span>
        <p><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/s/ref=nb_sb_noss/141-9368514-6016051?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=the+secret+by+rhonda+byrne&rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Athe+secret+by+rhonda+byrne">The Secrety</a> by Rhonda Byrnes is a classic self-development book. It is frequently referenced by athletes and other individuals as a tool of their success.</p>

        <p>
          <h3>Lessons from the book</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>The secret is the law of attraction</li>
            <li>You attract what you think about</li>
            <li>Yo change your life, change your thoughts</li>
            <li>The law of attraction is in-discriminatory, the reason many people don't succeed is because they fixate on the things they don't want and the universe gives them more of this</li>
            <li>Think of thoughts as literally leading to creation, because they actually do; your current thoughts are molding your future</li>
            <li>Meditation is the best way to become aware of your thoughts</li>
            <li>This explains why affirmations are so powerful</li>
            <li>Make your last thoughts before going to sleep good ones</li>
            <li>Affirmations to practice: "my thoughts become things", "I am a master of my thoughts"</li>
            <li>Take complete responsibility for everything that happens in your life, even seemingly accidents</li>
            <li>"Nothing can come into your experience unless you summon it through persistent thoughts"</li>
            <li>It is difficult to monitor all of the thoughts which you have throughout a day, so observe your feelings, as they are signals to the type of thought frequencies dominating your mind</li>
            <li>It is impossible to feel bad and at the same time have good thoughts, and vice versa</li>
            <li>If you feel bad, change your thoughts to good thoughts</li>
            <li>Secret Shifters: a list of things which instantly lift your mood (e.g. music, nature, loved-one, a memory, etc.)</li>
            <li>By the law of attraction, if you think that life is hard and a struggle, you will experience life as hard and a struggle</li>
            <li>affirmations to practice: "This is a magnificent Universe", "I deserve all good things life has to offer"</li>
          </ul>
