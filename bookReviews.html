        <h1> Does the book "The Secret" really work? </h1>
        <span class="byAuthor">By Samira Gadri &#124; Sept 5th, 2018</span>
        <p><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/s/ref=nb_sb_noss/141-9368514-6016051?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=the+secret+by+rhonda+byrne&rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Athe+secret+by+rhonda+byrne">The Secrety</a> by Rhonda Byrnes is a classic self-development book. It is frequently referenced by athletes and other individuals as a tool of their success.</p>
        <p>
          <h3>Lessons from the book</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>The secret is the law of attraction</li>
            <li>You attract what you think about</li>
            <li>Yo change your life, change your thoughts</li>
            <li>The law of attraction is in-discriminatory, the reason many people don't succeed is because they fixate on the things they don't want and the universe gives them more of this</li>
            <li>Think of thoughts as literally leading to creation, because they actually do; your current thoughts are molding your future</li>
            <li>Meditation is the best way to become aware of your thoughts</li>
            <li>This explains why affirmations are so powerful</li>
            <li>Make your last thoughts before going to sleep good ones</li>
            <li>Affirmations to practice: "my thoughts become things", "I am a master of my thoughts"</li>
            <li>Take complete responsibility for everything that happens in your life, even seemingly accidents</li>
            <li>"Nothing can come into your experience unless you summon it through persistent thoughts"</li>
            <li>It is difficult to monitor all of the thoughts which you have throughout a day, so observe your feelings, as they are signals to the type of thought frequencies dominating your mind</li>
            <li>It is impossible to feel bad and at the same time have good thoughts, and vice versa</li>
            <li>If you feel bad, change your thoughts to good thoughts</li>
            <li>Secret Shifters: a list of things which instantly lift your mood (e.g. music, nature, loved-one, a memory, etc.)</li>
            <li>By the law of attraction, if you think that life is hard and a struggle, you will experience life as hard and a struggle</li>
            <li>affirmations to practice: "This is a magnificent Universe", "I deserve all good things life has to offer"</li>
          </ul>

          <br>

          <h3>How to Use the Secret</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>accept: your whole life and everything in it has been created by you</li>
            <li>accept: the law of attraction is always present and always listening to everything you think, speak and act</li>
            <li>step 1: Ask
              <ul> <li>get clear on what you want, write it down in the present tense, and ask for it once </li> </ul>
            </li>
            <li>step 2: Believe
              <ul>
                <li>believe you have received it, that it is yours the moment you asked, with complete and unwavering faith</li>
                <li>start with make-believe, pretending as if you have received it, until you transition into really believing you have</li>
                <li>don't worry about the how</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>step 3: receive
            <ul>
              <li>feel the way you will feel once it arrives</li>
              <li>affirmation: "I am receiving now"</li>
              <li>do what will help you feel as if you've received it (e.g. test drive that car, go shop for that home, get inside it, etc.)</li>
              <li>if you are in action to try and get it, you've already slipped backwards; inspired action is effortless and feels wonderful because you are on the frequency of receiving it</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>always think your day in advance, "I have going to have a pleasant day"</li>
          <li>always think you have enough time, "I have more than enough time"</li>
          <li>when waiting or idle, use time to imagine all of the things which you want</li>
          </ul>

          <br>
          <h3>Practical Advice</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>before sleep, go through events of the day, and imagine all the events going perfectly as you intended, this emits a positive frequency for tomorrow</li>
            <li>every morning, get up saying "thank you" while thinking about the things your grateful for and continue saying it throughout your morning routine (aim for a 100 thank yous)</li>
            <li>incorporate gratitude in the Ask process by giving thanks as if you've already received the thing you want ("I am so happy and grateful now that..."), this emits powerful signals to the universe</li>
            <li>each morning, before you get out of bed, make it a habit to feel the feelings of gratitude in advance for the great day ahead  - as though it is done</li>
            <li>practice visualization to such a depth that you no longer desire the thing you want because you feel as though you already have it</li>
            <li>Vision Board:
              <ul>
                <li>paste pictures and visuals of the things you want and how you want life to be</li>
                <li>place it somewhere accessible</li>
                <li>believe you can have it and believe you deserve it</li>
                <li>close your eyes for a few minutes everyday, visualize having the things and feel the feelings of having those things now</li>
                <li>trust the universe will figure out how to manifest it</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <br>

          <h3>Wealth</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>eliminate thoughts of poverty and lack of money, think in wealth and abundance</li>
            <li>visualize yourself  rich now, visualize the lifestyle you want to have</li>
            <li>declare how much you want to make, believe it, and act as if its already achieved it</li>
            <li>the shortcut to anything you want in life is to be and feel happy now</li>
            <li>make yourself feel happy about money, to love money</li>
            <li>change thoughts of "I have to work hard and struggle for money" into "money comes easy and frequently"</li>
            <li>when you see something you want, say "I can afford that, I can buy that"</li>
            <li>play games with yourself to convert money problems into actually receiving money (e.g. imagine your bills are actually checks, be grateful for them; then pay your bills with satisfaction)</li>
          </ul>

          <br><br>

          <h3>Relationships</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>make certain that your thoughts, words, actions and environment do not contradict your desires aka what you "Ask" for</li>
            <li>if you want a significant other, take actions that indicate you already have them</li>
            <li>feeling bad about yourself is destructive to all your other endeavors, and it makes it impossible to feel good in general</li>
            <li>treat yourself like you want others to treat you:  <i>"If you do not treat yourself with love and respect, you are emitting a signal that is saying you are not important enough, worthy enough, or deserving."</i> </li>
            <li>highlight and focus on your positive qualities and the law of attraction will give you more positive qualities to be happy about; do the same for the people in your life (versus focusing on and complaining about their negative qualities)</li>
          </ul>

          <br>
          <h3>Health</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>the placebo effect demonstrates the power of the mind</li>
            <li>stress has a detrimental effect on your health, and stress stems from thought</li>
            <li>if you're suffering from health complications, don't focus on or think about all that is wrong; believe and pretend that you are as healthy as you want to be</li>
            <li>laughter really is a medicine</li>
          </ul>

          <br>
          <h3>The Secret to the World / The Secret to You / The Secret to Life</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>the words <i>I am...</i> are extremely powerful</li>
            <li>the complete affirmation: "I am whole, perfect, strong, powerful, loving, harmonious, and happy"</li>
            <li>there is no blackboard in life that states your purpose, meaning that it can be whatever you want it to be</li>
            <li>we are unlimited beings, there is no ceiling</li>
            <li>inner happiness is the fuel for success</li>
            <li> <i>"Whether you think you can or think you can't, either way you are right." - Henry Ford
            "The secret is the answer to all that has been, all that is, and all that will ever be." - Ralph Waldo Emerson</i></li>
          </ul>

          <br>
          <h3>Implementation</h3>
          This book presents ideas that have been reiterated across many other texts, from ancient times to the present. Nonetheless, even if it serves as a reminder, it does so in an interesting and appealing manner. It has a good load of actionable advice that one can immediately apply to their life and notice a difference. This includes the Vision Board, Ask, Believe and Receive, affirmations to practice, and visualization routines. The greatest obstacle to the implementation is simply forgetting about all of the valuable ideas it presents. It takes a lot of effort to be constantly conscious of your thoughts and the law of attraction and it is easy to simply finish the book and not think about the ideas further.
